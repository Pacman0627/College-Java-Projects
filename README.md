This is a repository for all my Programming Projects done in College.
I plan to upload these at the end of each semester.
Fall 2023 I took Computer Science Principles (1302) w/ Professor Billy Harris, Spring 2024 I took Computer Programming Principle (2302) w/ Professor Billy Harris.
Ignore the .class files. Those were in the folder that was uploaded to the repository. One will be created when the .java file is compiled and ran correctly.
Most if not all my code comments were written by A.I
